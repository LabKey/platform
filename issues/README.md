# LabKey Issues Module

The LabKey Issues module provides an issue tracker, a centralized workflow system for tracking issues or tasks across 
the lifespan of a project. Users can use the issue tracker to assign tasks to themselves or others, and follow the 
task through the work process from start to completion.

For further details about the usage and workflow see the following documentation:
[LabKey Issue/Bug Tracking].
