 *
 * a Qube is a wrapper for a Cube or Cube like structure. Each level in the cube will generate a map of sets.
 *
 * The level map is a collection of Member->MemberSet entries where the MemberSet is the collection of key Members that
 * have this 'attribute'.
 *
 * For instance, the key attribute level might be [Subject].[Subject], and the Gender level may have a few members such as
 * [Gender].[Male], [Gender].[Female], [Gender].[Unknown]
 *
 * Each member will have an associated set of participant members.
 *
 * [Gender].[Male] -> {[Subject].[P001], [Subject].[P002]}
 * [Gender].[Female] -> {[Subject].[P003], [Subject].[P004]}
 * [Gender].[Unknown] -> {[Subject].[P005]}
