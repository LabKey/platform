Label: Message Board and Discussion Service
Description: A workgroup or user community can use LabKey message boards \
    to post announcements and files and to carry on threaded discussions. \
    A message board is useful for discussing ongoing work, answering \
    questions and providing support, and posting documents for project users. \
    Message boards can also be used to track and document workflow task \
    completion and coordinate handoff of responsibility for different steps \
    when a more involved issue tracking system is not warranted.
