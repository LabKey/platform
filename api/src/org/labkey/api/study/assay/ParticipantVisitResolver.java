 * Helps resolve and validate information during an assay's copy-to-study operation. Since each row will need to be
 * associated with a participant and date/visit to be incorporated into the target study dataset, different
 * implementations may use other context to automate filling them in. For example, an implementation could use a
 * specimen ID column that's in the assay data to find the associated specimen in the target study and automatically
 * use its participant and date/visit values.
