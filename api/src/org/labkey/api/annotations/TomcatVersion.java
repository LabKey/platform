/**
 * Created by adam on 7/25/2015.
 *
 * Used to mark code that is specific to a particular version of Apache Tomcat, for example, hacks that allow JSPs compiled
 * with one version of Tomcat to run in a different version. Re-evaluate these when new Tomcat versions are supported or
 * support for old ones is removed. Search for text "@TomcatVersion" to find all usages.
