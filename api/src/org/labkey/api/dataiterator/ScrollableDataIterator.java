 * Adds the ability to rewind a {@link DataIterator} to before its first row of data.

 * (MAB) I go back and forth between adding methods to DataIterator and having extended/marker interfaces.
 *
 * I'm going to go with the idea of having the 'purest' interface possible, and see how it goes.
 *
 * Why have the isScrollable() method on a ScrollableDataIterator interface? This is so that wrapper/pass-through
 * base classes can pass-through the scrollability of their input class if appropriate.
