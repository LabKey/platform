//
// A thread-safe hash set that uses lock striping just like ConcurrentHashMap... because it IS a ConcurrentHashMap. This
// is a drop-in replacement for Collections.synchronizedSet(new HashSet()) that provides much better performance and
// scalability, albeit with a couple caveats:
//
// - ConcurrentHashSet does not support null elements; use a marker object instead.
// - Synchronizing is not needed for iterating a ConcurrentHashSet; in fact, if replacing a synchronized set, all
//   previous synchronization on the set itself must be removed.
