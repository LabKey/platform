/**
 * Specify comma-separated names for an action. Once this annotation is added to an action, it replaces the
 * standard naming, so you must include the default name if you want it to continue resolving.
 * For example, if you annotate GetDataAction and want http://server/controller/container/getData.view to resolve,
 * you must include "getData" in your value string.
 *
 * First name in the list is the "primary" name -- it's used when the class is passed to ActionURL.
