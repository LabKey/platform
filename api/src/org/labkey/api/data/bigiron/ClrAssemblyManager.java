/**
 * User: tgaluhn
 * Date: 1/16/2017
 *
 * Central registration of individual assembly installation managers. Mainly so BaseMicrosoftSQLServerDialect doesn't need to know
 * about all of them in order to gather any appropriate admin warning messages. It would be nice to also centralize the calls to
 * ensureInstalled(), but a) GroupConcat is a special case that has to be checked as part of the core upgrade (as other upgrades
 * depend on it), and b) there's only one other assembly at the moment.
