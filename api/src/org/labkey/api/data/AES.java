/**
 * First reference to {@link org.labkey.api.data.PropertyManager} constructs the stores which causes initialization of the PropertyEncryption enum.
 * The AES128 enum requires the property manager (we store the standard salt in properties), so we use a holder pattern
 * (instead of normal static initialization) to implement thread-safe lazy initialization, breaking the loop.
 *
 * This class is only used by the PropertyManager; other encryption users should call Encryption.getAES128() directly.
