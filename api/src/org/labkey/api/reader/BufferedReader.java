/*
This is a copy of an alternate implementation of java.io.BufferedReader.
see https://github.com/google/google-authenticator/blob/master/mobile/blackberry/src/com/google/authenticator/blackberry/BufferedReader.java
We use this implementation as it grows its buffer incrementally instead of allocating marklimit immediately (as java.io.BufferedReader)
This implementation has only been changed as follows
    1) setEnforceMarkLimit(bool) when set, read operations won't allow reading past the set mark limit
    2) throw MarkLimitExceededException if a read would exceed the mark limit (no partial reads)
