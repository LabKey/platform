    <!--
    <library> tag not declared!

    Our gradle "compressClientLibs" task expects all resources in a <library>
    to be available at the beginning of compilation. The files for @labkey/api
    are copied from node_modules and are thus not available until after npm has been run.

    The workaround is to declare the files as <dependencies> only.

    <dependencies>
        <!-- @labkey/api - see core/package.json for version -->
        <!-- This is copied into platform/core/web by platform/core/build.js -->
        <dependency path="clientapi/labkey-api-js-core.min.js"/>
    </dependencies>
