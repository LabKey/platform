-- DROP all views (current and obsolete)

-- NOTE: Don't remove any of these drop statements, even if we stop re-creating the view in *-create.sql. Drop statements must
-- remain in place so we can correctly upgrade from older versions, which we commit to for two years after each release.

-- core.UserSearchTerms view was removed in 18.2. This drop statement could be removed in release 21.1.
