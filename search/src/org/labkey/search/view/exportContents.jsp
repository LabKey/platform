<p>Click one of the buttons below to export details about the full-text search index in the specified format. Each export file
includes one row for each document in the index, listing details such as title, type, folder, url, unique id, and unique body
term count. Body term count is an approximate, relative measure of the size of this document in the index.</p>

<p>Use Excel or your favorite tool to sort, filter, and pivot the data. For example, sort by term count to identify the largest
documents in the index. Or sum body terms by folder path to determine folders contributing the most to index size.</p>

<p>Note: A file format warning message may appear when exporting to Excel; click "Yes" and the data should correctly appear.</p>
