# LabKey List Module

A List is a flexible, user-defined table that is defined 
and managed via the LabKey Server web UI. The schema of a list can be 
defined manually, created using the schema of another list as a template, 
or inferred from the contents of a data file. Lists can be linked via 
lookups and joins to create custom views that draw data from many sources. 
Populated lists can be exported and imported as archives for easy transfer 
between development, staging and production folders or servers.
