Label: List Service
Description: A List is a flexible, user-defined table that is defined \
    and managed via the LabKey Server web UI. The schema of a list can be \
    defined manually, created using the schema of another list as a template, \
    or inferred from the contents of a data file. Lists can be linked via \
    lookups and joins to create custom views that draw data from many sources. \
    Populated lists can be exported and imported as archives for easy transfer \
    between development, staging and production folders or servers.
